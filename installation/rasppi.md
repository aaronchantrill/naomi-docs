# Raspberry Pi

Because of its **low price**, **small form factor** and the **low energy consumption**, the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) is a quite popular platform and thats no different for Naomi.
It is favored amongst existing users and a recommended choice for newcomers.

If you want to learn more about the possibilities of the Raspberry Pi and Linux in general, many tutorials can be found on the internet.
These including the official [raspberrypi.org help articles](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help) or the in-detail articles at [eLinux.org](http://elinux.org/RPi_Tutorials).

Recommendations for a ["headless"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_computer) hardware setup:


- [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/).
- USB Microphone (Has been tested with [Akiro Kinobo USB Microphone](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XVXKDXC/))* but should work with just about any USB microphone. You can also use a USB webcam with integrated microphone. Having a video camera would allow you to let Naomi "see" using the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org) library.
- [8GiB SD Card](https://www.amazon.com/Sandisk-Ultra-Micro-UHS-I-Adapter/dp/B07GH5J77R) (16GiB recommended if you would like to play with DeepSpeech and/or Kaldi)
- [Ethernet Cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N2VILDM/)
- [Airlink Mini-USB Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Airlink101-AWLL5088V2-Wireless-Ultra-Adapter/dp/B00EE940IG) (optional â€” see below)
- [Micro-USB Cable](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Male-Micro-Cable-Black/dp/B0711PVX6Z/) (to supply power)
- [USB Wall Charging Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-One-Port-USB-Wall-Charger/dp/B0773J79KC/) (to supply power)
- [Speakers that work through the Raspberry Pi audio jack (probably need to be self-powered)](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/1749789584867681205)

The [Raspberry Pi Verified Peripherals List](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/) may be helpful for finding substitutes for the products recommended above.

> *note that other mics do work but have not been tested. A complete list of supported mics will be coming soon!

As mentioned above, the wireless adapter is optional. Naomi runs just fine on a wired connection (via ethernet), so you can choose between the two setups depending on what works best for you. Newer Raspberry Pi's (Pi Zero W, 3B+, 4) have wireless networking built in and no longer require an additional wireless adapter.

## Recommended Setup

We provide a **preconfigured image** for the Raspberry Pi, with the latest build of Naomi and many useful software components.
The image provided by the **Naobian** project is based on Raspbian and under constant improvement.

Check out more details about [Naobian, the hassle-free Naomi setup](naobian.html).

## Manual Setup

Setting up Naomi manually yourself is a great way of learning more about the technology used.
Naomi is an ongoing project and depends on ideas and code contributions from citizen scientists.
One of the most interesting parts of working with Naomi is thinking about how you think, and applying that knowledge to helping Naomi solve problems.
If you want or need to set up Naomi on a Raspberry Pi by yourself, please follow these recommendations.
For the beginning, we recommend to [download](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian) and [install](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md) the latest Raspbian SD card image.
You may choose the "Lite" version. You can choose to use other distros such as Arch or SuSE, but it's a good idea to go through the process on Raspbian first so you understand what you are trying to do.

**Attention:**
As of the November 2016 release, Raspbian has the SSH server disabled by default.
You will have to enable it manually. Additionally, the latest version of Raspbian, Buster, now requires that you select a region where your Raspberry Pi will be used before it will activate your wireless interface, meaning that you will have to connect to the Pi over an ethernet cable to configure wireless.
For headless setup, SSH can be enabled by placing a file named "ssh", without any extension, onto the boot partition of the SD card.

**Connecting:**
Get your SD card and network cable plugged in and power up.
To connect with an SSH client (like [Putty](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/windows.md)), you need to know the IP address or hostname of your device.
A standard Raspbian setup should be reachable either by the hostname "raspberrypi" or though the local domain name "raspberrypi.local".
If you are not able to connect, check your routers web frontend for newly connected devices. The linux command "nmap" can also be helpful at locating your Raspberry Pi.

**First Steps:**
Connected via SSH, execute the Raspbian configuration menu by running `sudo raspi-config`.
Go through the following steps:

- Expand the file system (this should be done for you automatically, but you might want to use the `df -h` command to verify that the filesystem matches the capacity of your SD card)
- Change your password
- (Change the host name if you wish, e.g. "naomipi")
- Select your Wi-Fi country through "Localization" -> "Change Wi-fi Country"
- Restart

As a good practice, run a full upgrade and install packages you like or need:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt upgrade
```

**Note on Python:**
Raspbian in the latest full version already includes Python 2 and Python 3.
However, at the time of setup, the Naomi install updates and downloads Python just to be safe.

**Installation:**
To get Naomi up and running all you need to do is follow the steps described on the [download](/download/) page for RaspberryPi and the version you would like to use.
